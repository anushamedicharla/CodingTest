					<h1>Centralize your Inventory</h1>
					<p>Getting your inventory organized is one of the best things you can do for your business. As you will see by using Stitch, inventory is at the heart of your business and gaining control of your inventory means you gain control over your business as a whole. </p>
					<p>Keeping an accurate inventory count means that you can “always be selling.”  Proper management keeps your sales growing from reordering products that are running low to updating listings with current availability.</p>
